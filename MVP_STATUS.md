  - Dry-run mode for testing

- **Mailchimp Publisher** (`internal/publish/mailchimp.go`)
  - Campaign creation
  - HTML email formatting
  - Draft mode (requires manual review before sending)
  - Dry-run mode for testing

#### 5. Automation ✅
- **Cron Scheduler** (`cmd/runner/main.go`)
  - Daily check at 9:00 AM
  - Detects data changes automatically
  - Only publishes when new data is available
  - Graceful shutdown handling
  - Signal handling (SIGINT/SIGTERM)

#### 6. Configuration ✅
- **Environment-based Config** (`internal/config/config.go`)
  - `.env` file support
  - Feature flags for publishing platforms
  - AUTOPUBLISH kill-switch
  - DRY_RUN mode for safe testing
  - Validation for required settings

#### 7. Testing ✅
- Unit tests for:
  - Configuration loading
  - Publishing (dry-run mode)
  - Core data structures
- Test coverage: ~100% for config, ~13% for publish (dry-run paths)

#### 8. Documentation ✅
- `README.md` - Complete setup and usage guide
- `DEPLOY.md` - Full production deployment guide
- `Taskfile.yml` - Common development tasks
- Code comments and inline documentation

```

## 📊 What Works Now

1. **Daily automated monitoring** of US Dollar Index
2. **Change detection** - only acts on new data
3. **Content generation** with compliant disclosures
4. **Chart visualization** of time-series data
5. **Optional publishing** to LinkedIn and Mailchimp
6. **Database persistence** of all data points
7. **Audit trail** of all publications

## 🚀 Deployment Options

### Option 1: Linux Server (Recommended)
- Systemd service for automatic startup
- Journal logs for monitoring
- See `DEPLOY.md` for step-by-step guide

### Option 2: Docker Container
- Dockerfile included in deployment guide
- Volume mounts for data persistence
- Easy updates and rollbacks

### Option 3: Cloud Functions/Workers
- Can adapt for serverless (GitHub Actions, Cloudflare Workers)
- Cron triggers instead of local scheduler

## ⚙️ Current Configuration

### Monitored Series
- **DTWEXBGS** - US Dollar Index (Trade-Weighted Broad)

### Schedule
- **Daily**: 9:00 AM (configurable in `main.go`)

### Safety Features
- `DRY_RUN=true` - Test without actual API calls
- `AUTOPUBLISH=false` - Manual review before posting
- Dry-run logs show what would be published

## 🎯 Next Steps (Post-MVP)

From the original 14-day plan, these are **not yet implemented** but planned:

### Additional Data Sources
- [ ] COFER (IMF reserve currency data)
- [ ] SWIFT RMB Tracker (monthly PDF parsing)
- [ ] CIPS stats (web scraping)
- [ ] World Gold Council data

### Advanced Features
- [ ] RMB Penetration Score calculation
- [ ] Reserve Diversification Pressure index
- [ ] Alert webhooks for threshold breaches
- [ ] YouTube Short video generation
- [ ] Admin UI for content approval
- [ ] Playbook generation (Crash-Drill Autopilot)

### Monitoring & Analytics
- [ ] Post engagement tracking
- [ ] Email open/click rates
- [ ] Dashboard with historical trends
- [ ] Alert system for data anomalies

## 📋 Pre-Deployment Checklist

- [ ] Obtain FRED API key
- [ ] (Optional) Set up LinkedIn app credentials
- [ ] (Optional) Set up Mailchimp account and API key
- [ ] Create `.env` file with credentials
- [ ] Test locally with `DRY_RUN=true`
- [ ] Verify database migrations work
- [ ] Check output/ directory is writable
- [ ] Review generated content templates
- [ ] Set `AUTOPUBLISH=false` initially
- [ ] Deploy to server following `DEPLOY.md`
- [ ] Monitor logs for first 24 hours
- [ ] Verify cron job triggers at expected time

## 🔧 Building & Running

### Local Development
```bash
# With CGO (full features)
CGO_ENABLED=1 go build -o bin/reserve-watch cmd/runner/main.go
./bin/reserve-watch

# Run tests
go test -v ./internal/config ./internal/publish
```

### Production Build
```bash
# For Linux server
GOOS=linux GOARCH=amd64 CGO_ENABLED=1 go build -o reserve-watch cmd/runner/main.go
```

## 📝 Notes

### CGO Requirement
- Required for SQLite (go-sqlite3) and chart generation (gg)
- Linux servers typically have GCC pre-installed
- Windows developers: install mingw-w64 or TDM-GCC
- See README.md for detailed instructions

### API Rate Limits
- FRED API: 120 requests/minute (more than sufficient)
- LinkedIn API: Varies by app permissions
- Mailchimp API: Varies by plan

### Database
- SQLite is perfect for single-instance deployment
- Can migrate to PostgreSQL if needed
- Regular backups recommended (see DEPLOY.md)

## ✨ Summary

The MVP is **production-ready** for monitoring a single FRED series and generating/publishing content. The application is:

- ✅ **Functional** - All core features working
- ✅ **Tested** - Key components have unit tests
- ✅ **Documented** - Complete setup and deployment guides
- ✅ **Safe** - Dry-run and feature flags prevent accidents
- ✅ **Maintainable** - Clean architecture, easy to extend

Ready to deploy and start monitoring de-dollarization trends! 🚀
