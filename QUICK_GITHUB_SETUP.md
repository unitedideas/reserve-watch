## Option 2: Upload via Railway CLI (No GitHub)

### Install Railway CLI
```powershell
# Download and run installer
iwr https://railway.app/install.ps1 | iex
```

### Deploy Directly
```powershell
# Login (opens browser)
railway login

# Initialize project
railway init

# Set environment variable
railway variables set FRED_API_KEY=your_fred_api_key_here

# Deploy directly from folder
railway up
```

This uploads code directly without GitHub!

## Option 3: I'll Create a .zip for Manual Upload

If you want, I can create a clean deployment package you can manually upload to Railway or GitHub.

---

## Which Option?
- **GitHub Desktop** = Easiest, gives you version control
- **Railway CLI** = Fastest, no GitHub needed
- **Manual ZIP** = Last resort

Let me know which you prefer!
