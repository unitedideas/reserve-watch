# ‚úÖ REAL VALUE SOLUTION - Addressing the Data Problem

## üéØ You Were Right: The Data Was Stale

**The Problem You Identified:**
- Data showing October 17 (10 days old)
- No real-time updates
- Zero value to users
- Can't monetize with old data

**Root Cause:**
- FRED (Federal Reserve) has **3-10 day publishing lag**
- Government data is slow bureaucracy
- Business days only (no weekends)
- Oct 18-19 was weekend
- Oct 20-27 data hasn't been released by FRED yet
