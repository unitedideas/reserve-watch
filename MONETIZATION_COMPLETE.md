## Technical Stack

### Backend
- Go 1.22 (fast, efficient, low hosting cost)
- SQLite (simple, embedded, perfect for this scale)
- FRED, Yahoo, IMF, SWIFT, CIPS, WGC APIs
- Stripe Go SDK v76

### Frontend
- Server-side HTML templates (fast, SEO-friendly)
- Chart.js (beautiful, interactive charts)
- Vanilla JavaScript (no framework bloat)
- Dark purple theme (modern, professional)

### Infrastructure
- Railway (auto-deploy from GitHub)
- Custom domain: reserve.watch (ready to configure)
- Cron jobs for data updates (15min for DXY, daily for others)

### Data Flow
```
External APIs â†’ Go Ingesters â†’ SQLite â†’ Web Server â†’ HTML Templates â†’ User Browser
     â†“                                        â†“
  Mock Fallback                         Stripe Checkout
```

## What's Different From Other Dashboards

### 1. Multi-Signal Synthesis
Most dashboards show ONE thing (DXY or gold or reserves). Reserve Watch shows ALL of them:
- Official USD strength (FRED)
- Real-time market price (Yahoo)
- Central bank behavior (IMF, WGC)
- Payment infrastructure (SWIFT, CIPS)

### 2. Proprietary Indices
**RMB Penetration Score** = payments Ã— reserves Ã— infrastructure
**Reserve Diversification Pressure** = gold trend + CB buying

No one else publishes these.

### 3. Actionable Alerts
Not just "here's the data" - it's "DXY broke 120, RUN THIS CHECKLIST NOW."

### 4. Emergency Playbook
The `/crash-drill` page is unique. No other dashboard says:
"Here's your 6-step plan if the dollar crashes tomorrow."

### 5. Business Model
Most macro dashboards are free (no revenue) or $500+/mo (enterprise only).
Reserve Watch hits the sweet spot: $9/mo for prosumers, $39/mo for teams.

## Compliance & Disclaimers

âœ… **Data Licensing:** Comprehensive disclaimers on `/methodology`
âœ… **Investment Advice:** Clear "not financial advice" footer on all pages
âœ… **Data Sources:** All sources linked and attributed
âœ… **Update Frequency:** Clearly stated (15min for DXY, daily for others)
